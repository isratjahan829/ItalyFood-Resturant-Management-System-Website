      <h3>Healthy food tips:</h3>
          <b><p>8 tips for making healthy choices at a restaurant
           Restaurant dining can be a landmine for those watching what they eat. Tempting menu options, secret calorie bombs and a just-this-once mindset can wreak havoc on even the most disciplined diet.</br></br>

         1. Remember “no BOSS.” Whenever possible, ask that your meal be prepared without butter, oil, salt and sugar. Ask for your vegetables steamed with butter on the side, request that no salt be added to your entree and ask for salad dressing, sauces and creams on the side. You can still have butter, oil, salt and sugar, but this strategy allows you to control how much you consume.  </p>
          <p>2. Don’t drink your calories. Smoothies, alcoholic beverages and soft drinks cause calories to add up quickly. That fancy cocktail can be the caloric equivalent of a milkshake. Stick with good old H20. If you crave more flavor, request lemon, lime or cucumber slices for your glass.</p><p>3. Choose a healthy appetizer. It’s easy to consume a lot of calories when you start with an appetizer. Many are fried and/or come with creamy dips. This starts the meal in the wrong direction. Your body will crave more fat, salt and sugar</p></b>

        <h3>3.Risotto Balance Exercise:</h3>
        <p>Balance exercises (stand on one leg).Improve balance by standing on one leg for 30 seconds on each leg.Picture yourself gracefully stirring a pot of creamy risotto.

        <h3>4. Italian Spice Lunges:</h3>
        <p>Add a twist by incorporating side-to-side lunges, mimicking the motion of sprinkling Italian spices.Think of the rich aroma of Italian herbs while lunging.</p>

          <b><p>4. Fill up on vegetables. Most restaurants are willing to work with customers. A simple way to save calories and fat, plus sneak in extra nutrition, is to swap out a carbohydrate-heavy side dish (think: pasta, rice or potatoes) with a side of steamed vegetables (sans oil, butter or salt).</br></br>

         5.Avoid sneaky salad saboteurs. Salad can be healthy, but many contain unhealthy ingredients – like fried tortilla strips, cheese, dressing and bacon bits – that ramp up the calorie count. Ask for dressing on the side and use it sparingly. The best way to spruce up greens, according to Komar? Add fresh, colorful veggies – the more color, the better.</p>
          <p>Nix the extra salt. Salt acts as a food enhancer, but it doesn’t actually provide flavor, says Komar. Plus, too much salt can lead to some serious health problems. Put down the salt shaker and try fresh lemon or lime juice, or vinegar instead.<br></br></br>
          6. Look at portion sizes. Restaurant portion sizes are often much bigger than what we should consume, so share an entrée or take half of it home to eat the next day. Even when you can’t control the content, you can control the quantity of what you eat, says Komar.</p></b>
